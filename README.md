Health impacts all of us around the globe and to this day it still increases despite given the various amounts to technological advances in the recent years. To combat this issue, my partner and I decided to create a dietary tracking application that will be user-friendly pushing users to combat health issues by tracking their diet every day! The application will consist of daily and weekly totals and goals set by professionals and personal goals which will help understand how to cut down on calorie intake to lose weight or to just eat healthy.
