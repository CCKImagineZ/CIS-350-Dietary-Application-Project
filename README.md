# 1 | Abstract
The impact to once lifespan caused by how healthy or well, they have taken care of their body is immense. Today, I seek to solve not just an issue I have but many people around the globe have Aswell. The leading cause of an unhealthy body is the food that we consume containing harmful chemicals and overall large quantities of carbohydrates and or calories causing people to gain weight and lose control of a well taken care of body. Many different solutions have been created to help people to combat these issues or prevent weight gain. My solution incorporates many of these great applications and ideas that others have founded before the creation of the Dietary Loss application and encompasses them into one seamless, free, and user-friendly application that can be found on both android and apple stores. The seamless design will allow for ease of access and use, which from experience many other applications seemed too intimidating and too confusing and most were hidden behind a paywall. Our goal is to deliver this application to anyone for free, the revenue will accumulate from advertisements placed along the UI. Speaking of the UI, it will be simple with only a few buttons on the page to press leading the focus on the weekly breakdown of the userâ€™s weight loss journey. You will be able to track your calorie counts on a day-to-day basis or weekly basis whatever fits your schedule. Tracking will be easy as there will be a graph that is interactive showing the breakdown of each day showing the total calories of that day thus far and for the whole day. Additionally, a total calorie count for the week will appear on the top of the screen to show you where you are and hopefully will help you track where you want to be. Next, the UI for a meal entry is simplistic and user friendly. The use of drop-down menus for the day of the week and what type of meal makes it easy to quickly add a meal especially since we all have intensive work weeks. Additionally, the use of an interactive calendar makes it easy to indicate when you had the meal!

# 2 | Introduction
Dietary and health issues stem throughout the world, which is the leading reason why my team decided to work on a dietary tracking application. Within this app users will be able to add, delete, or compare different meals that they have eaten throught the day/week/month. Various additions such as a visual representation of their daily calorie goal will help users to track how much they can have to reach their desired goal. Additionally, later on the addition of suggesting new foods to add to the database aswell as the option for scanning products and using the bar code found on the food item to search throught the database. We hope that this app will help users not only lose weight but impower themselves to live a much healthier lifestyle.

# 3 | Architectual Design
Our application will use a server based architecture that will have access to a database which is yet to be decided but most likely will use mysql. The user will access the application which will be ran on the server which will then communicate and store information accordingly to the database side of thing.

# 4 | UML Diagram
The program for the server side of the application can be shown using a UML diagram of the cases and how they interact with eachother and the user. Our app consists of 4 currently, the Food, Drink, Diet, and User classes that each contribute to the operation of the application having their own attributes and methods.

# 5 | Use Case Diagram
In addition to the UML diagram, a use-case diagram was constructed to show what the our app can provide for the user. Different available actions will be implimented down the road but for now, our structure consists of these actions.

# 6 | Sequence Diagram
To map out the general program work flow, we used a sequence diagram to display the layout and workflow of the dietary application!

# 7 | UI Design
Our current UI Design is shown below, the use of two different pages one being the main page that displays the calorie count for the week and calorie bar chart for each day. The second page is one that displays a data entry for a meal with meal name, calorie count, what day it is, and type of meal.

# 8 | Workflow
Our team is using Jira to help manage our project via sprints to each goal that we have in mind. This is the link to our Jira that we plan to use and an image of the first epic that we have completed! https://fairfiea.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/CS3DAP/boards/2
