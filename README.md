# CIS 350 | Dietary Application Project
Created by Aaron Fairfield and Austin Garijo

# 1 | Abstract
Health impacts all of us around the globe and to this day it still increases despite given the various amounts to technological advances in the recent years. To combat this issue, my partner and I decided to create a dietary tracking application that will be user-friendly pushing users to combat health issues by tracking their diet every day! The application will consist of daily and weekly totals and goals set by professionals and personal goals which will help understand how to cut down on calorie intake to lose weight or to just eat healthy.

# 2 | Introduction
Dietary and health issues stem throughout the world, which is the leading reason why my team decided to work on a dietary tracking application. Within this app users will be able to add, delete, or compare different meals that they have eaten throught the day/week/month. Various additions such as a visual representation of their daily calorie goal will help users to track how much they can have to reach their desired goal. Additionally, later on the addition of suggesting new foods to add to the database aswell as the option for scanning products and using the bar code found on the food item to search throught the database. We hope that this app will help users not only lose weight but impower themselves to live a much healthier lifestyle.

# 3 | Architectual Design
Our application will use a server based architecture that will have access to a database which is yet to be decided but most likely will use mysql. The user will access the application which will be ran on the server which will then communicate and store information accordingly to the database side of thing.

# 4 | UML Diagram
The program for the server side of the application can be shown using a UML diagram of the cases and how they interact with eachother and the user. Our app consists of 4 currently, the Food, Drink, Diet, and User classes that each contribute to the operation of the application having their own attributes and methods.

# 5 | Use Case Diagram
In addition to the UML diagram, a use-case diagram was constructed to show what the our app can provide for the user. Different available actions will be implimented down the road but for now, our structure consists of these actions.

# 6 | Sequence Diagram
To map out the general program work flow, we used a sequence diagram to display the layout and workflow of the dietary application!

# 6 | UI Design
We have not designed the UI for our application but we do have a direction we are planning to go with, we have decided to go with a front page that is filled with the daily calorie count with a visual representation the the amount left until the user hits their goal. This visual represenation will be in the shape of a fruit to encompass a healthy look to the app front page. Other uses will be buttons on the front page either at the bottom of the screen or on the side to help the user navigate through the various different settings and actions found within our app.

# 7 | Workflow
Our team is using Jira to help manage our project via sprints to each goal that we have in mind. This is the link to our Jira that we plan to use and an image of the first epic that we have completed! https://fairfiea.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/CS3DAP/boards/2
